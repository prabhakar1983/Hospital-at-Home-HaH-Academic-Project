# Hospital-at-Home-HaH-Academic-Project
Academic Project 
Hospital-at-Home (HaH) programs offer acute care services in patients' homes, providing benefits such as reduced hospital re-admissions and increased patient satisfaction. Despite their potential advantages, the distribution and impact of HaH programs across the United States remain underexplored. This project aims to utilize business analytics to investigate the distribution of HaH programs and their association with county-level demographics and health outcomes through the following research questions:
1.What is the geographic distribution of Hospital-at-Home programs across the United States, and how does it correlate with ZIP/County & State-level demographics?
2.How are county-level medical professional, hospital density factors related to healthcare programs.  
3.What is the relationship between the availability of HaH programs and local health outcomes, such as hospital readmission rate.
